# Read4Ever

Chinese reading app designed to build literacy through exposure to real sentences. Users read one sentence at a time, reveal its meaning, and mark known words to track progress.

The app uses a scoring system: words gain points each time they’re marked as known. Sentences are re-ordered based on the combined word scores — easier ones show up later, and harder ones repeat more often. 

### Features
- Adaptive sentence feed based on known word scores
- Tap to reveal sentence translations
- Hold to mark known words
- Simple interface focused on reading, not studying
- HSK vocabulary focus (starting with HSK 1)

### Tech Stack (Planned)
- Flutter (frontend)
- local storage JSON files (Data)
- Python for sentence generation

### Status
MVP in progress — focused on HSK 1 sentence generation and word scoring system.

### Future Plans
- Add sentence difficulty tiers up to HSK 6
- User accounts with progress saving
