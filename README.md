# Read4Ever

**Read4Ever** is a minimalist Chinese reading app designed to build literacy through endless exposure to real sentences. Users read one sentence at a time, reveal its meaning, and mark known words to track progress.

The app uses a smart scoring system: words gain points each time theyâ€™re marked as known. Sentences are re-ordered based on the combined word scores â€” easier ones show up later, and harder ones repeat more often. No levels, no sessions, just constant, casual reading.

### Features
- Adaptive sentence feed based on known word scores
- Tap to reveal sentence translations
- Hold to mark known words
- Simple interface focused on reading, not studying
- HSK vocabulary support (starting with HSK 1)

### Tech Stack (Planned)
- React + Tailwind CSS (frontend)
- Node.js / Express (backend)
- SQLite or Firebase (for storing word scores)

### Status
ðŸš§ MVP in progress â€” focused on HSK 1 sentence generation and word scoring system.

### Future Plans
- Add sentence difficulty tiers up to HSK 9
- User accounts with progress saving
- Smart recommendations based on weak words
